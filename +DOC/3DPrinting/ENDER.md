Needs 300+ Degrees C. Micro Swiss hot end is **crucial** since it has a titanium heatbreak. The Ender 3 Pro factory hot end doesn't have that. The PTFE bowden tube could melt and give off **toxic** fumes!
### Prerequisities
* [ ] Micro Swiss hot end
* [ ] Type K thermocouple (Not compatible with Melze) + breakout board
* [ ] Disable part cooling
* [ ] Probably an enclosure for the printer
* [ ] Dry filament. Dry the filament with perforated spools and wind loosly.
