# Simon's Repo - Introduction
This is a place where I collect useful info and upload my
sketches, small utilities and work on my progress.

# Structure
Structural folders are prefixed with a `+`
Projects are named with one of the following prefixes and suffixes for improved visual grepping.
> Prefixes are used to divide the project into rough supergroups.
> Suffixes are used to specify the subprojects main programming language

## Project prefixes
- NN.   = NeuralNetwork
- BG.   = Backgrounds for Web use
- GAME. = Self explanatory
- SIM.  = Simulations
- FNC.  = Functions
- APP.  = Application


# Additionally
- Subprojects should include their own README.md file if further information is required
